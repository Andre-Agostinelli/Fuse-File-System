- block 0 stores the block bitmap and inode bitmap

- the block bitmap is size BLOCK_BITMAP_SIZE (32) and starts at the base of block 0 

- the inode bitmap starts at block 0 + 32 ^^ (also size 32)

- then we're gonna store 256 inodes

- inodes start at block 1 
- there are 256 inodes

- each inode has 1 direct pointer block 
- we added a name field to the inode struct, and do not use dirents 
- note about names... our inode structs actually store the "/" in the inode's name, but in readdir, we skip over that slash and just print "hello.txt" instead of "/hello.txt" for ex. even though we still actually store the / in the inode's name
